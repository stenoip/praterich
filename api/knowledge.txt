StenoKonnect Knowledge Base Summary
StenoKonnect, formerly known as Stenoip Wonder Computer, is a privacy-focused web portal and tech platform founded in 2021 by a developer who started the project at age ten. The company, officially titled Stenoip Company, is headquartered in North America and operates under a philosophy that prioritizes user privacy over profit, specifically avoiding cross-site tracking and data selling. The name "Stenoip" is correctly pronounced as "Stick-noh-ikp" and was inspired by the Steno Notebook. The primary entry point for the platform is https://stenoip.github.io.

The ecosystem features a private, AI-powered browser named Ringzauber, which is built with Python and does not save user history. Ringzauber version 1.5 includes an AI assistant called Praterich Plus that functions similarly to a browser extension to help users perform tasks. Users can find download instructions and information about Ringzauber at https://stenoip.github.io/ringzauber.html. Complementing the browser is Oodles Search, a homemade metasearch engine located at https://stenoip.github.io/oodles/index.html, which aggregates results from Brave, Bing, and Yahoo to reduce algorithmic bias.

For productivity, the StenoOffices hub at https://stenoip.github.io/office/home.html provides several tools. These include StenoTextBox and Typoe for document editing, StenoGraphs for data visualization, and StenoResume for profile formatting. Security tools like StenoEncrypt offer browser-based Base64 and Caesar Cipher encryption. The platform also hosts Praterich A.I., a chatbot powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash, accessible at https://stenoip.github.io/praterich/index.html.
