My loooooooong summer of working How the Glorious Praterich and Ringzauber 1.5 was made. Ringzauber is fixed, for now. Too many errors in the last one! If you got a \"Farwell Card\", see this! One last goodbye.\n\n--- Content from https://stenoip.github.io/ringzauber.html ---\nRingzauber Ringzauber is a private browser made by Python that does not save your history. It is easy use by anyone and aviable to use on Windows 7, 8.1 and 10 and 11. Ringzauber Logo Best used with SearXNG (note, we did not create this)! Download SearXNG in your terminal. Instructions here . What truly sets Ringzauber apart in the crowded landscape of web browsers is its foundational commitment to privacy. Unlike many mainstream browsers that often log and store extensive user data, Ringzauber‚Äôs architecture is specifically designed to prevent the persistent storage of your browsing activities. The browser‚Äôs internal history list is not saved to a file, ensuring that once a session ends, your browsing trail vanishes. This deliberate choice means that no local record of your viewed pages or search queries is built or saved, reinforcing its promise of a history-free browsing experience. This contrasts sharply with browsers that, by default, collect and retain vast amounts of data about your online behaviour. However, even with Ringzauber‚Äôs robust privacy features, it is a significant mistake to use search engines like Google. Google, a dominant force in online search, operates on a business model heavily reliant on data collection. Every search query, every click and every interaction is meticulously logged and analysed to build comprehensive user profiles. This data is then used for targeted advertising and other commercial purposes. Therefore, even if Ringzauber prevents local history saving, using Google on it would still expose your search activities to extensive third-party tracking, undermining the very privacy Ringzauber aims to provide. For those serious about maintaining their online anonymity and privacy, SearXNG is the recommended alternative. SearXNG is a free meta-search engine that aggregates results from over 70 search services, but crucially, it does so without storing any information about its users. It does not track your IP address, use cookies, or create profiles. By routing your search queries through SearXNG, you effectively anonymise your searches, preventing individual search engines from linking queries back to you. This combination of Ringzauber‚Äôs history-free browsing and SearXNG‚Äôs privacy-respecting search capabilities creates a powerful shield against pervasive online surveillance. Beyond its strong privacy safeguards, Ringzauber excels in user-friendliness and adaptability. Built using the lightweight PyQt5 and QtWebEngine frameworks, it offers a responsive and efficient browsing experience. The browser supports multiple languages including English, German, Spanish, Mandarin, Frisian, French and Ga, making it accessible to a diverse global user base. Features like easy tab management, quick navigation controls‚Äîback, forward, reload, home‚Äîand a customisable theme toggle contribute to a streamlined and personalised browsing environment. The ability to add and manage bookmarks allows users to quickly return to their favourite sites without compromising their privacy by maintaining a persistent browsing history. Ringzauber distinguishes itself as a premier private browser by offering a secure, history-free and user-centric web experience. Its Python-based development ensures a lightweight application, while features like multi-language support and intuitive navigation make it an accessible choice for anyone seeking to protect their online privacy. By focusing on essential browsing functionalities and consciously omitting data retention features, Ringzauber empowers users to navigate the internet with confidence and peace of mind, especially when paired with a privacy-focused search engine like SearXNG.

Well, not really. I am going to take a break. Every day(s) in a week, I will be constantly working on my website. Why? Well it was to develop Praterich of course? Praterich is my very on A.I chatbot powered by the model Gemini 2.5 flash\n        (I will of added GPT-4 but it requires a subscription. You may be asking, why am I using Gemini Flash? Should I make why very own? Well first, I do not have a server\n        complex in the desert like Google or OpenAI. Second, Microsoft did it with Microsoft Copilot. Praterich was a success. She gave correct responses, was able to generate some code\n        and was well smart. But, I can image in the year 2034, everyone will be able to make a chatbot. So I decided to go big. That's right, I decided to put Praterich on Ringzauber! It all started when I was in the shower. I thought \"What does my browser have that other's don't\"?\n        I earlier used Google Assistant and I got an idea. What if Praterich can control Ringzauber. And so I started working. It took a few months but I am finally finished. Most hurdles where bugs in the code. It took a long time to fix them. Unforunately, some bugs remain. During the time I was fixing some bugs, I was saving some of my ideas for another update. Still, I was pleased with my work. I called some friends over and they said they liked it. Hopefully, you do too. Download here . I suggest filling the Google Forms to tell me your review and how I can fix Ringzauber. About Me Obiviously, I can't tell about me. It's the Internet!

Download now! Thursday 17th July 2025 Image Remember that whole big anouncement for Ringzauber Browser. Yeah, I think I released it a bit too early. The problems it had where that you could not add another window, there was no search engine and lots of bugs. In version 1.4, all of that is fixed! Enjoy a better private browser. How is it private? If you look on the Browser, you see no history. I did that purposely. There are some problems. Do not click the Inspect button! It closes the program for some reason. Also, Windows think my app is a threat. Do not worry, I have not interest in making viruses. I don't even know how to do that. That warning will have to be fixed.
